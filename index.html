    <h1>This is a first level heading in HTML. With CSS, I will turn this into red color</h1>
    <h2>This is a second level heading in HTML. With CSS, I will turn this into blue color</h2>
    <h3>This is a third level heading in HTML. With CSS, I will turn this into green color</h3>
    <p>This is a <em>paragraph</em> As you can see, I placed an emphasis on the word "paragraph". Now, I wil change also 
      the background color of the word "paragraph" to black, and its a text color to green, all with just CSS.</p>
      <p>The main essence of this tutorial is to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Show you how to format a web document with HTML</li>
            <li>Show you how to design a web page with CSS</li>
            <li>Show you how to program a web document with JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Next, I am going to add the following to numbers and display the result, all with JavaScript</p>
          <p>first number:<span id= "firstNum">2</span> <br></p>
          <p>Second number: <span id= "secondNum">7</span></p>
          <p>Therefore, the sum of the two of those numbers is: <span id= "answer">(placeholder for the answer)</span></p>
          <input type="button" id="sumButton" value="Click to add!">
